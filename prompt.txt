use python to convert the above yaml to excel with columns
LOV_TYPE
LOV_VALUE
LOV_DISPLAY_VALUE
LOV_PARENT_TYPE
LOV_PARENT
LOV_SEQUENCE



where LOV TYPE is one of:
PROCESS_GROUP
PROCESS_TASK
PROCESS_DEPENDENCY
PROCESS_REF
PROCESS_DESCRIPTION
PROCESS_TOOL
PROCESS_POC
PROCESS_DAY
where LOV SEQUENCE checks if a LOV PARENT has more than 1 of the same LOV TYPE then LOV SEQUENCE is the order of which LOV TYPES appear

LOV_VALUE and LOV_DISPLAY VALUE is the same for dependency, day, description
Modify the yaml if you need, let me know what are the modifications to the yaml


where LOV_Sequence determines the sequence of every child LOV_Value if there is more than one LOV_Type in a parent
